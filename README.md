# redux-devtools-adapter

Simple adapter to connect Effector's Inspect API to Redux DevTools, extracted from the old `effector-logger` project.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add -D @effector/redux-devtools-adapter
```

## Usage

### Prepare metadata

To make logs more useful we need additional metadata (like names, locations in the code, etc), which is provided by one of the `effector` plugins.

#### Babel-plugin

Babel-plugin is built-in in the `effector` package.

Just add it to your babel configuration.
```json
{
  "plugins": ["effector/babel-plugin"]
}
```

It is also useful to enable `loc` generation for dev environment, to see for exact locations of `sample`s and other operators in the code.

```json
{
  "plugins": [["effector/babel-plugin", { "addLoc": true }]]
}
```

[Read the docs](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/babel-plugin/#usage)

#### SWC Plugin

[Read effector SWC plugin documentation](https://github.com/effector/swc-plugin)

### In the code

Just call `attachReduxDevTools()` somewhere in your project's entrypoint.

You can also provide some additional configuration. Example:
```ts
import { attachReduxDevTools } from "@effector/redux-devtools-adapter";

attachReduxDevTools({
  name: "Name of your app, will be visible in the Redux DevTools",
  scope,
  /**
   * ☝️ (optional) effector's Scope, if you use it
   *
   * @see https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/scope/
   * @see https://dev.to/effector/the-best-part-of-effector-4c27
   */
  trace: true,
  /**
   * ☝️ enables traces of effector's calculations for every log. `false` by default
   */
  devToolsConfig,
  /**
   *
   * Redux DevTools extension config
   *
   * @see https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools/blob/main/extension/docs/API/Arguments.md
   */
});
```
